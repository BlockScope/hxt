\subsubsection*{Description}

The Holumbus framework consists of a set of modules and tools
for creating fast, flexible and highly customizable search engines with Haskell.
The framework consists of two main parts. The first part is the indexer for extracting the data
of a given type of documents, e.g. documents of a web site, and store it in an appropriate index.
The second part is the search engine for quering the index.

An instance of the Holumbus framework is the Haskell API search engine Hayoo!
(\uri{http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/}. The web interface for Hayoo! is
implemented with the Janus web server, written in Haskell and based on HXT~\cref{hxt}.
