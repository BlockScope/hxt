\subsubsection*{Description}

The Holumbus framework consists of a set of modules and tools
for creating fast, flexible, and highly customizable search engines with Haskell.
The framework consists of two main parts. The first part is the indexer for extracting the data
of a given type of documents, e.g., documents of a web site, and store it in an appropriate index.
The second part is the search engine for querying the index.

An instance of the Holumbus framework is the Haskell API search engine Hayoo!\
(\url{http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/}).

The framework supports distributed computations for building indexes
and searching indexes. This is done with a MapReduce like framework.
The MapReduce framework is independent of the index- and
search-components, so it can be used to develop distributed systems
with Haskell.

The framework is now separated into four packages, all available on
Hackage.

\begin{compactitem}
\item The Holumbus Search Engine 
\item The Holumbus Distribution Library
\item The Holumbus Storage System
\item The Holumbus MapReduce Framework
\end{compactitem}

The search engine package includes the indexer and search modules,
the MapReduce package bundles the distributed MapReduce system.
This is based on two other packages, which may be useful for their on:
The Distributed Library with a message passing communication layer
and a distributed storage system.

\subsubsection*{Features}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Highly configurable crawler module for flexible indexing of structured data
\item Customizable index structure for an effective search
\item {\em find as you type} search
\item Suggestions
\item Fuzzy queries
\item Customizable result ranking
\item Index structure designed for distributed search
\item Git repository containing the current development version of all packages under
  \url{https://github.com/fortytools/holumbus}
\item Distributed building of search indexes
\end{compactitem}

\subsubsection*{Current Work}

There are two running projects. The first, a masters thesis done by Sebastian Schr\"oder,
deals with the development of a framework for news systems. The functionality
will be like with google news, but the target is to build news systems for specialized topics.
We expect to finish this project at the end of 2011.

In the second project a specialized search engine for our university web site has been built.
The new aspect in this application is a specialized free text search for appointments, deadlines,
announcements, meetings and other dates. There is a running prototype of this search engine.
We expect to finish this work in November 2011 and then to use this engine as the official
search engine of our university web site.
