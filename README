Installation of the Janus application server 0.2.0
=================================================

You have to build two parts for a Janus application server: A Haskell library package (janus.a), which integrates all basic system modules, but
no main application. The library package is a prerequisite for a runnable server.

To the library package depends on various other Haskell packages described in "janus-libray/Janus-Library.cabal".
It does not require the hs-plugins library for dynamic loading of Haskell binaries. This package made a lot of
trouble in the past, because it is depended on the ghc version and a the bytestring package delivered with ghc.
It requires GHC >= 6.8

Quick Janus installation:
=========================

tar xvzf janus-0.2.0.tar.gz
cd janus-0.2.0
cd janus-library
make all
cd ..

make all is a shortcut for the 3 usual steps with cabal: configure, build and install


A Janus Application:
====================

There is an example application for a Janus test server under dir "static-janus".
To build this application perform

cd static-server
make janus
./janus

The last line will start the server, which is listening on port 8080.
To test the server, access "http://localhost:8080/index.html" and hopefully the test server
home page shows up.

A specific application can be derived from the "static-server" dir.
There is a "conf" subdir in which the file "server.xml" for the server configuration
is stored. This XML config file must be tailored th the needs of a specific app.

The application specific source files are usually located in subdir "source" in the
package Network.Server.Janus.Shader. There the Janus servlets sources are located.


cd build
./janus

Jaunus will then listen on port 8080.
check "http://localhost:8080/index.html for a running server.
The janus state can be queried by giving commands on the janus console.

In case of the hs-plugins package, an error message may occur stating lacking permissions for the configuration script. Please change the file
permissions of the "configure" file in the hs-plugins directory accordingly.

If you installed the janus-1.0 package, you may optinally continue with building an executable Janus server installation. This may be done simply by
invoking "make janus". Afterwards you will find a relocatable Janus installation in the ../build subdirectory. In the ../build/conf directory, there will be a
default configuration file "server.xml". The ".../build/Network/..." subdirectories contains the servlet object files to start the server.
