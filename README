Installation of the Janus application server v1.0
=================================================

You may build two parts of the Janus application server: A Haskell library package (janus.a), which integrates basic system modules, and a runnable server
installation. The library package is a prerequisite to the runnable server. However it may also be used without a binary server installation to develop
servlet modules. 

To build the library package, the following is required:

- GHC 6.4.2 
- http-bundle 20060707
- HXT 7.0
- fps 0.7 (ByteString)
- hs-plugins 1.0-rc0

The four libraries are contained in the /libs directory. They may be installed by means of the following steps:

1. Use e.g. "tar -xvzf [...].tar.gz" to extract the respective source files.
2. Move into the created directory and start building the package with Cabal...
3. Use "ghc --make -o Setup Setup.lhs" or "ghc --make -o Setup Setup.hs" to generate the setup binary.
4. Use "./Setup configure" to create the compilation script.
5. Use "./Setup install" to register the library with your GHC system.

Order of installation is arbitrary, except for the http-bundle. This library is required to build the HXT-7.0 package and has to be created and registered
in advance. Finally the procedure to create the janus-1.0 package is the same.

In case of the hs-plugins package, an error message may occur stating lacking permissions for the configuration script. Please change the file
permissions of the "configure" file in the hs-plugins directory accordingly.

If you installed the janus-1.0 package, you may optinally continue with building an executable Janus server installation. This may be done simply by
invoking "make janus". Afterwards you will find a relocatable Janus installation in the /build subdirectory. In the /build/conf directory, there will be a
default configuration file "server.xml". The "/build/Network" subdirectory contains the servlet object files to start the server.
