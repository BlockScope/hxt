Installation of the Janus application server v1.0
=================================================

You may build two parts of the Janus application server: A Haskell library package (janus.a), which integrates basic system modules, and a runnable server
installation. The library package is a prerequisite to the runnable server. However it may also be used without a binary server installation to develop
servlet modules. 

To build the library package, the following is required:

- GHC 6.6
- http-bundle 20060707
- HXT 7.2              or newer
- fps 0.7 (ByteString) or newer
- hs-plugins 1.0-rc0   or newer

The four libraries must be installed, before compiling Janus

Order of installation is arbitrary, except for the http-bundle. This library is required to build the HXT package and has to be created and registered
in advance

Quick Janus installation:
=========================

tar xvzf janus-1.0.tar.gz
cd janus-1.0
make all

make all compiles all janus sources, copies the server into the build dir
and copies all example pages to build/wwwpages and build/errorpages.
All dynamically loaded modules are copied to build/Network/...
The default janus config file is copied to build/conf/server.xml

Start of Janus:
===============

cd build
./janus

Jaunus will then listen on port 8080.
check "http://localhost:8080/index.html for a running server.
The janus state can be queried by giving commands on the janus console.

In case of the hs-plugins package, an error message may occur stating lacking permissions for the configuration script. Please change the file
permissions of the "configure" file in the hs-plugins directory accordingly.

If you installed the janus-1.0 package, you may optinally continue with building an executable Janus server installation. This may be done simply by
invoking "make janus". Afterwards you will find a relocatable Janus installation in the ../build subdirectory. In the ../build/conf directory, there will be a
default configuration file "server.xml". The ".../build/Network/..." subdirectories contains the servlet object files to start the server.
