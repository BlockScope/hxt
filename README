The Haskell XML Toolbox is a collection of tools for processing XML with
Haskell.

The Haskell XML Toolbox is available from:
    http://www.fh-wedel.de/~si/HXmlToolbox/

Detailed information about the features, changes, requirements, installation and documentation
is available from that web page.

This is the "old" approach with the
filters like in HaXmL. For
new projects we strongly recomend the
library based on arrows

good luck
